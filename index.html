Remember to apply your beginner CSS skills to style your website. Focus on using appropriate colors, fonts, spacing, and layout to make your website visually appealing. You can experiment with basic CSS properties like background colors, font styles, margins, padding, and box shadows.

You can host your website on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify for free to make it accessible to others.

Remember to keep practicing and exploring more advanced concepts as you continue to improve your web development skills. Good luck with your website! -->
